# IIT-KGP Data Science Hackathon

Welcome to our submission for the Data Science Hackathon conducted by IIT-Kharagpur in January 2024. Our goal was to formulate an algorithm that delivers returns on BTC-USDT using historical data from 2018 to 2022.

## Repository Contents

### Notebooks
- **GoldenCross.ipynb:** Implementation of a trading strategy based on the Golden Cross (SMA crossover).
- **IITKGP-KWANT.ipynb:** Notebook related to KWANT, possibly for quantum computing or optimization.
- **UnsupervisedModel.ipynb:** Implementation of an unsupervised learning model. (Needs further exploration)
- **whit_model.ipynb:** Final XGBoost model for BTC-USDT returns. (The main final model)

### Python Scripts
- **blek_goldcross_final.py:** Python script related to "blek_goldcross_final". (Need to explore the content and provide a brief description).
- **blek_unsupervisedmode_final.py:** Python script related to "blek_unsupervisedmode_final". (Need to explore the content and provide a brief description).
- **bollinger_bands.py:** Python script related to Bollinger Bands.
- **updated_model, updated_model2, updated_model3, updated_model4, updated_model5:** Folders with iterations and improvements on the XGBoost model for BTC-USDT returns.

### Data
- **BTC-USD.csv:** Dataset containing historical data for BTC-USD.
- **sp500_historical_data.csv:** Dataset containing historical data for the S&P 500.

### Images
- **BTCUSDT-2018-01-01.png, BTCUSDT-2022-31-01.png:** Images related to BTCUSDT. (Check for details)

## Usage
