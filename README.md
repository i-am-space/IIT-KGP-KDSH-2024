# IIT-KGP Data Science Hackathon

Welcome to our submission for the Data Science Hackathon conducted by IIT-Kharagpur in January 2024. Our goal was to formulate an algorithm that delivers returns on BTC-USDT using historical data from 2018 to 2022.

## Repository Contents

### Notebooks
- **GoldenCross.ipynb:** Implementation of a trading strategy based on the Golden Cross (SMA crossover).
- **IITKGP-KWANT.ipynb:** Notebook related to KWANT, possibly for quantum computing or optimization.
- **UnsupervisedModel.ipynb:** Implementation of an unsupervised learning model. (Needs further exploration)
- **whit_model.ipynb:** Final XGBoost model for BTC-USDT returns. (The main final model)

### Python Scripts
- **blek_goldcross_final.py:** Golden crossover strategy. Needless to say, not the finest performance and not my finest moment.
- **blek_unsupervisedmode_final.py:** Unsupervised learning algo, not the greatest performance either.
- **bollinger_bands.py:** Python script for a Bollinger Bands strategy (this is getting embarassing now)
- **updated_model, updated_model2, updated_model3, updated_model4, updated_model5:** Folders with iterations and improvements on the XGBoost model for BTC-USDT returns.

### Data
- **BTC-USD.csv:** Dataset containing historical data for BTC-USD.
- **sp500_historical_data.csv:** Dataset containing historical data for the S&P 500.

### Images
- **BTCUSDT-2018-01-01.png, BTCUSDT-2022-31-01.png:** Images related to BTCUSDT. (Check for details)

## Usage

### Golden Cross Strategy
Check the implementation in **GoldenCross.ipynb** for a trading strategy based on SMA crossover.

### Unsupervised Model
Explore **UnsupervisedModel.ipynb** for the implementation and results of an unsupervised learning model.

### XGBoost Model
Find the final XGBoost model in **whit_model.ipynb**, and explore the **updated_model** folders for iterations and improvements.

I'm absolutely certain there are several people out there that can do FAR better than we did, and we do welcome you to try and let us know the results!
